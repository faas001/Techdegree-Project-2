# Techdegree-Project-2
List pagination

This is project 2 in the Treehouse Techdegree program.

It starts with a static list of Students hard coded into HTML

We then start with a blank javascript file to create the code to dynamically paginate the page into blocks of 10, complete with
navigation buttons and search functionality. 

This provided a great opportunity to dig into selecting, inserting, modifying HTML elements from JavaScript code.

There was much googling and trial and error utilized during this project.

Time to complete was probably over the 12 hours estimated but less than 20. Maybe.
